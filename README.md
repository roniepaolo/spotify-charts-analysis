<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roniepaolo/spotify-charts-analysis/master/images/pipeline.png" alt="drawing" width="1000"/>

Academic work for my Data Analysis course. This repo contains analysis of Spotify Charts Top 200 for every country available. The goal is to determine if the worldwide lockdown have affected people in every country. In order to achieve this goal, we assume that tracks play an important role, since people listen to music according to their moods.

## Usage

Just explore the notebook in order to do the analysis yourself. We deployed a dash dashboard in an EC2 with docker-compose.
